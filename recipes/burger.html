        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            That old saying, "If it's not broken, don't fix it," is sound advice in almost all areas of life with<br>
            one very notable exceptionâ€¦ the kitchen. Many of our favorite dishes are versions of perfectly fine <br> 
            recipes that we've tweaked and twisted into something new and exciting, and this Banh Mi Burger <br>
            is a great example. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chunk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef, fish sauce, soy sauce, freshly ground black pepper, <br>
                and 5-spice powder in a bowl, and mix until evenly combined. Cover <br> 
                with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
            <li>Mix mayonnaise, hoisin, and Sriracha together in a small bowl for sauce. <br>
                Keep chilled until needed.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
            <li>Cut open rolls, remove about 1/2 of the inside crumb, and place on the <br>
                prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, using damp hands, shape beef mixture into two burger patties <br>
                sized to match your rolls or buns. Keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Combine carrots and daikon radish in a bowl. Add rice vinegar and toss to coat.<br>
                Refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <li>Preheat a charcoal grill to high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook burgers over the hot coals until desired doneness is reached and they spring back <br>
                to the touch, turning as needed, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read <br>
                thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Slather toasted buns with mayo mixture. Place cucumbers and jalapeno slices on bottom of rolls,<br>
                and top with cooked burgers. Top with carrot-radish mixture and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
